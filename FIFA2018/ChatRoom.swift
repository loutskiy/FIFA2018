/*
Each ChatRoom represents a chat conversation with the peer it represents.

For simplicity, when a chat room is created, a connection is created to the remote peer, which is used to send chat messages.
This means that both participating peers create a connection, i.e. there are two connections between the peers, even though one would be enough.

Files can be exchanged in using the ChatRoom class. To transmit a file, a new connection is established. First, the file name is transmitted, then the actual file.
After transmission, the connection is closed.

Therefore, the first incoming connection from a remote peer is used to receive chat messages; any further connections are used to receive files.
